Getting Started
###############

The program requires no install to get started. 

Simply download the binary from `GitHub <https://github.com/c-arthurs/TMAPP>`_ and start the program - it will need you to authourise that it is from an unknown developer. 

The startup may take a while - as it was compiled with PyQt5 but should run well once the GUI starts.
