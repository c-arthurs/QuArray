Getting Started
###############

QuArray is a stand-alone, platform independent application (designed for Windows, Mac or Linux operating systems),
and requires only a correct binary file to be downloaded. The binary is available from
`GitHub <https://github.com/c-arthurs/QuArray>`_.

The application may take a short while to start (as it is compiled with PyQt5 as a single executable file) however,
this is not a problem once the GUI is initialised.

  .. note::
     An example whole slide image file and excel document is hosted
     `here <https://emckclac-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/k1472221_kcl_ac_uk/EutLIT4yc3BIlmNdUnDzLNAB0AcR1qc99Pvf8w-yCcmj_A?e=LXunb4>`_
