Installation

Getting Started
###############

The program requires no install to get started. It should work on either MacOS, Linux, or windows operating systems
when the correct binary is downloaded.

Simply download the binary from `GitHub <https://github.com/c-arthurs/QuArray>`_ and start the program -
it will need you to authorise that it is from an unknown developer.

The startup may take a while - as it was compiled with PyQt5 as a single file executable
but should run well once the GUI initialises.
