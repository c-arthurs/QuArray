Getting Started
###############

QuArray is a stand-alone, platform independent application (designed for Windows, Mac or Linux operating systems),
and requires only a correct binary file to be downloaded. The binary is available from
`GitHub <https://github.com/c-arthurs/QuArray>`_.

The application may take a short while to start (as it is compiled with PyQt5 as a single executable file) however,
this is not a problem once the GUI is initialised.
